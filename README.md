### Background
This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>. <a href='https://provath.org'>The Providence Athenaeum</a> presently has a site for digital collections available at digital.provath.org managed and created by me using a customized version of <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveMechanics/sckls-omeka">InteractiveMechanics/ sckls-omeka</a> project available on Github. It uses the free CRM <a href="https://omeka.org">Omeka</a>, which provides a robust system for cataloging digital objects to library standards.

### Future development
The data provided by the Omeka is unwieldy and not intuitive. I decided to stop at this point in the development of the front-end to begin creating a GraphQL server based off the Omeka API in order to streamline and improve data retrieval from the server. The project is hosted on GitHub. 
After the server is built the plan is to use this as the institutions public site while maintaining the backend Omeka CMS used by librarians.

### FAQ/ Troubleshoot
Please contact me at brendan.ryan@pm.me with any questions regarding the project. I would be happy to help anyone with questions or who is working to develop their own Omeka site at their institution.
